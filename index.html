								<br>	
								<p>Born in 1984, I grew up around the early computers (amiga) and gaming consoles (Sega, Nes Etc) But as I‚Äôve gotten older my interests have become more varied, I enjoy DIY projects around my home and working on my old car on the side. I only got my car license in 2016 aged 32, prior to that I cycled everywhere until getting a motorbike license at age 27. I was involved in an accident that broke my left Tibia (bone below the knee) and dislocated my right hip. The recovery was slow but considering the extent of the injuries I have recovered well. I don't get to play as much these days, and no longer own any consoles apart from my original NES. Here are my wife and I‚Äôs 2 cats, Fluffy and QT. They are brothers, and very pampered. I enclosed our entire property for them to be able to go outside but not get into any trouble.

								<h1>Lachlan-personal profile and ideal job </h1>

								<p>Hi I‚Äôm Lachlan Deck, student ID:s3976017 
									
									I was born in the United States of America, grew up in Tasmania from ages 1-13, where I exclusively lived on a 32ft motor sailing yacht. My family then moved to Melbourne, and shortly after, to Bangalore India for 9 months, then back to Melbourne. I‚Äôve played a lot of video games in my teens, and I hope to have a career in software development and eventually management. I‚Äôm interested in development and development management because of how tangible the problems are, and how effectual solving them can be. IT in general is a field of solution pursuit and I find that appealing. My Ideal job was an engineer in AWS‚Äôs quickstep team. Which is responsible for building ‚ÄúQuickstep‚Äù, a high-performance caching server, for amazons CloudFront. They are looking for applicants comfortable with agile, large-scale systems, web design, a modern programming language like rust, C/C++ or c#, and architecture/design. As well as ~5 years‚Äô experience.

								<h1>Declan Bermingham - student number s3971568</h1> 

								<p>	I am 19 years old, and my family is Mauritian, well my mum‚Äôs side and my dad‚Äôs side are Australian. My personal hobbies include Cars, Gaming, and fitness. I have a kitten called ash and computers and technology is a love of mine. I Have been involved in technology since I was 12, the first thing was games. My passion for games grew as I got older, and my type of genre is fps while still enjoying single player games. My interest in IT is EVERYTHING, it does not need to be specific. I am interested in how we just get better and better on the internet, or pixels on a certain screen. How we have evolved in technology to now project visuals like augmented reality, and how IT is changing people's lives. All these things are so fascinating, and this is what makes me so interested in it. My ideal job is to be a software engineer or a games developer, they both are similar but so far from close. The skills needed for these jobs are general involvement with C/C++ and java, or something like python and other languages for specific positions. The most common thing I came across was an average of 3-4 years' experience with coding. </p>
								<h1>Personal info and ideal job, Lucy (Luke) üòä</h1> 
								<P>	
									Preferred Name   Lucy  Student number: S3980747    group name Unicorn 
									
									I am 28 years old, born and raised in Byron Bay, a hardcore gamer and very interested in cyber security. I have a mug collection and I like cute things. My partner and I have 2 cats and foster kittens, we currently have 5 fosters. Technically I have played Dota 2 competitively but didn‚Äôt get very far. I have no professional IT work experience, but I attained my certificate IV in cyber security mid 2022. 
									
									My interest in IT has been slowly growing ever since I was younger playing games on my home computer when I was around 12 or 13 years old. When the pandemic first started affecting Australia, I lost my full-time job. I struggled to find a career path that I wanted to follow, then I stumbled onto the job trainer program and jumped at the chance to study cyber security. Ever since starting my Certificate IV in cyber security, I have been very interested in and seeking a career in Cyber security. 
									
									I gained firsthand experiences using various cyber security tools in assessments such as: Creating multiple virtual machines all set up on one physical computer so I could simulate a man in the middle attack to grab unencrypted credentials with Wireshark, creating and preforming a red vs blue incident response team exercise. There were other hands-on experiences, but those two stood out for me. These hands-on assessments really drove my hunger to continue to learn more about IT and cyber security.  
									
									My ideal job is a cyber security manager. 
									
									This position is at the top of the cyber security roles in a cyber security company. The role involves running the Cyber security business unit, incident response, GRC, leading and managing a response team. This position is appealing to me as I have thought of myself as a leader, is a senior cyber security position, has different aspects of the career that I would like, it sounds fun and exciting, finally the pay is impressive. This role requires: Previous experience in a cyber security management role such as CSOC manager; Experience in Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC); Data Loss Prevention (DLP), cyber security toolsets and firewall configurations. Ability to manage a Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) Must be Motivated, self-driven, focused on continuous improvement, have strong problem-solving skills and able to adapt to changes. Finally, this role also requires a tertiary degree in IT or related discipline and any industry certifications related to cyber security would be beneficial.

									<p>
								    Name: Adam Howell 
									
									Student Number: S3971006 
									
									Hello there! My name is Adam Howell and I am currently studying Information Technology at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology through Open University Australia, working in Group #40 called ‚ÄúUnicorn‚Äù. A little history about me, I'm a certified mechanic and had worked in the field for close to nine years. I decided to step away from that role and enter an industry of something I've also been passionate about, the world of I.T! I grew up playing video games from a very young age, my father brought home a PlayStation One with his first paycheck from his new job when I was around 5 years old. I grew up playing a variety of games like: Medal of Honor, Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot and many other games as I became older. Which then became an original Xbox console, then a Nintendo Wii and then an Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 was when I experienced the world of Online Play, connecting to matchmaking lobbies on Call of Duty with my friends after school. I then built my first computer around 2011 when I decided to select Multimedia as an elective in school. I have since built two computers since then with massive leaps in performance between each build. Information Technology has been an interest since my early childhood, and I am looking forward to developing skills by studying through RMIT University to advance my passion into a career in the Cyber Security industry! 
									
									 
									
									Ideal Job ‚Äì Cyber Security Operations Analyst 
									
									An IT Security Operations Analyst works as a team member to monitor and combat threats to an organization's IT infrastructure. They also evaluate security systems and procedures for flaws and potential enhancements, as well as provide technical support for security systems. For this role, some responsibilities include, but are not limited to security audits, liaising with stakeholders and other IT personnel, being in-charge of networks and servers, complying with policies and delegations that are applicable, and meeting targets & resolve problems promptly. This position intrigues me due to the high demand in this field of security work and can be argued to be the most important role in contemporary IT. I believe this is due to the exponentially growing IT sector, which comes with its growing security risks. This section of IT I believe is imperative for not just large, but small businesses as IT grows and the demand for security will become higher.

								<h1>So, what is cloud?</h1>
								<p> 

								    ‚ÄúJeff Bezos has likened Amazon Web Services to the utility companies of the early 1900s. One hundred years ago, a factory needing electricity would build its own power plant but, once the factories were able to buy electricity from a public utility, the need for pricey private electric plants subsided. AWS is trying to move companies away from physical computing technology and onto the cloud.‚Äù  
									
									investopedia- What Is Amazon Web Services and Why Is It So Successful?. 
									
									My anecdotally informed impression is that computing and storage are expensive to scale along with your customer base. As a company, your options are basically stop growing, build the infrastructure yourself (expensive), or rent the infrastructure from someone else (less expensive... most of the time). Data centers are the service that caters to that third option. 
									
									But what is cloud? Clouds are what happens when the biggest, baddest data centers eat all the other data centers, and everyone goes to them if they can't afford to make their own infrastructure. It's when remote computing and remote storage are provided to anyone with money and an internet connection. When I was in primary school, we got OneDrive, suddenly your schoolwork was available no matter what computer you logged into, because instead of being saved to an onboard hard drive you were saving it to a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù hosted on, or across warehouses full of racks of computers probably halfway around the world. But OneDrive isn't ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù it‚Äôs a service Microsoft provides. The cloud is the name given to remote computing as a whole. That cloud of invisible, centralized power, hosted on a bunch of data centers scattered around the world, is what we call, the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù 
									
									what are services and servers? 
									
									‚ÄúAs of the first quarter of 2021, one independent analyst reports AWS has over a third of the market at 32.4%, with Azure following behind at 20%, and Google Cloud at 9%.‚Äù  
									
									Investopedia- What Is Amazon Web Services and Why Is It So Successful? 
									
									Right now, AWS and Azure (Microsoft) are slugging it out for market control, but aside from the percentage of the worlds data centers that they own, how do they have control? Services and servers is the answer. Services are products that these companies provide, like ms teams, but also more backend things, like the amazon API gateway. Services are like subdivisions of what AWS or Azure could provide as one package, they divide like this to allow customers to pay only for what they want, and so they can charge as much as possible for what they do provide.  
									
									What are servers? If you googled it you would get ‚Äúa computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.‚Äù but in a cloud setting they are more like slices of computing power. The key thing about cloud computing is it's not central to one location, it is access to computing power hosted from all over the world. So what companies do is they go out and sell access to that pool, that access is a ‚Äúserver‚Äù hence the name it ‚Äúserves you‚Äù. That being said, I think usually what people mean when they say ‚Äúserver‚Äù is the computing and memory itself. 
									
									So to conclude, services are products that service providers like AWS and Azure provide, they either augment or enable certain features a customer wants, or they are  fully developed applications like ms teams. Servers are slices of the pool of computing power that cloud providers have, together with the ‚Äúservices‚Äù they form a blank slate of an online company. 
									
									 
									
									</p><h1>What is the likely impact?</h1><p>
									
									I think the impact of all this is that its near impossible for growing companies to avoid cloud services. with AWS at more than 200 and counting, they really have something for everything, and I think its getting hard to justify not using AWS. I also feel that this also pushes companies more towards growth over profit, AWS is not cheap to maintain, its only so appealing because it makes growth easier for companies. Particularly Netflix who spend an enormous amount on AWS, because they were growing so fast they needed AWS to keep up.  
									
									If you follow this link, you‚Äôll see pages and pages of services for a AWS customers, just like how we‚Äôre currently using Microsoft teams, because RMIT has the Microsoft suite. This makes it very difficult for businesses to leave AWS once they build their business around it. And its only when they get truly massive are they able to bear the cost of building their own solution. 
									
									‚ÄúIt was clear to us from the beginning that we‚Äôd have to build everything from scratch,‚Äù wrote Dropbox infrastructure VP Akhil Gupta on his company blog in 2016, ‚Äúsince there‚Äôs nothing in the open source community that‚Äôs proven to work reliably at our scale. Few companies in the world have the same requirements for scale of storage as we do.‚Äù 
									
									- Data Center Knowledge, Dropbox‚Äôs Reverse Migration, From Cloud to Own Data Centers, Five Years On 
									
									Another impact ‚Äúpay for what you use‚Äù models have had is I think they‚Äôve contributed to the massive push for data driven decision making, when you pay for 100% of your usage optimizing that usage to reduce costs is crucial. 
									
									Overall, I think clouds biggest impact is how it's made scaling possible, a decade ago companies could not grow like they can today, this isn't just the case for the company experiencing the need to scale either, companies don‚Äôt only use AWS for instance. They use all kinds of services like slack, zoom, Zendesk etc. All those companies also use cloud services, they can all scale to the demand of each other. That‚Äôs the impact of cloud services. 
									
									</p><h1>How will this affect you?</h1><p> 
									
									Well I plan to have a career in the IT sector, so at the very least I'll be working in a space enabled by clouds. I'll probably be using cloud run recourses in my Tech stack, and this is presuming that I don‚Äôt directly go into cloud engineering. As I said when I estimated its impact, cloud has changed the way companies develop, and I‚Äôll experience the new way of doing things throughout my career. 
									
									While not directly linked, the trend of everything being accessible online has already had a massive impact on me, for starters I‚Äôm studying online. This has allowed me to begin my career without the massive upheaval that would come with moving to Melbourne to study on campus. Beyond that the rise of remote work, or WFH has also changed my life, I've been able to spend more time with my father (who works remotely) and as a family where only able to live where we are because of my father‚Äôs work being remote. 
									
									Interviewing for roles has also changed massively due to the shift to online. Where once, one had to physically go to an office, interviews are mostly online now, especially in the IT sector. I wonder if the ease of hiring contributed to the employee led market that‚Äôs being touted today. The speed at which masses of people can find new jobs today is pretty amazing. This hasn‚Äôt affected me directly yet, but it will when I enter the industry. I think 5 years ago working for more than 6-10 years at a company was rare in IT, now I think companies are straining to retain talent for more than the time it takes their stock options to mature. 
									
									I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the rapid growth cloud allows that will affect me the most, how fast everything is and how ubiquitous technology can be because of it. </p>
									<h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
									<p> What does it do?
										 
										
										Cyber security is defined as the practice of defending computers, servers, networks, all types of IT devices and data from malicious attacks. These attacks generally fall into either; phishing, malware, ransom ware and social engineering. The more successful attacks will most likely use a combination of these 4 types. In essence cyber security in a business setting is all about reducing total costs when the eventuality of a cyberattack occurs.  
										
										There is a constant battle between cyber security professionals and the threat/bad actors (cyber attackers).  Is the company better protected and better prepared or has a new malware been created or vulnerability been found that may be the key in breaching the company's defenses? The methods and technologies that threat actors use is constantly evolving and so must the methods and technologies that companies use to protect themselves evolve in the same way.  
										
										An example of an attack is: A vulnerability is found in a newly updated software a company is running, which allows unauthorized access through the network. A black hat hacker targets this company because they are using this software that has this vulnerability. The hacker breaches the company network and has access to customer information. The company becomes aware of the attack when some data is accessed and stollen. The company contacts their cyber security operation center which begins their incident response procedure.  This will take many days and will cost the company in loss revenue and loss in trust by their customers as their data was stollen. In the end the attack has had a huge impact on the company which may never recover. This shows how important cyber security is.   
										
										The average cost to a larger company may be in the millions and the cost is increasing. ‚ÄúData breach average cost increased 2.6% from USD 4.24 million in 2021 to USD 4.35 million in 2022. The average cost has climbed 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report.‚Äù This report also shows that during the pandemic there was a much greater growth in cost to companies. 
										
										https://www.ibm.com/au-en/security/data-breach 
										
										‚ÄúFuture conflict will involve sophisticated cyber warfare. Nations across the globe have recognized the strategic value and asymmetric advantage of investment in offensive cyber capabilities.‚Äù In the future, cyber security will be a major contributor in how conflicts and even wars play out. Australia and many other countries recognize this and have started to strengthen their cyber security in their defense sectors. In the future, wars may end before even 1 bullet, or one life is lost as the impact that a state sponsored cyberattack can have on a countries infrastructure and resources leads to ending the conflict before it has even begun.  
										
										https://www.defence.gov.au/about/strategic-planning/defence-cyber-security-strategy 
										
										 
										
										</p><h1>What is the likely impact?</h1><p> 
										
										As cyber threats are constantly evolving and adapting to the current state of the world. As seen during, and post pandemic, there has been a large increase in the number of cyberattacks.  As technologies become more widely used and more popular, this also increases the likelihood of these technologies being impacted by a cyberattack. The more a technology is utilized the more profitable an attack is, more data to steal, more data to sell, more money to steal etc.  
										
										The pandemic has shifted a lot of companies into an operating model that focuses on employees safely which also encourages working from home. This also includes an increase in companies using software such as teams or zoom to conduct remote meetings. This new operating model must also include a level of cyber security that some companies are neglecting. The increase of usage of these virtual meeting applications also increases the amount of cyberattacks relating to these technologies. ‚ÄúBetween February and May 2020 more than half a million people globally were affected by breaches in which the personal data of video conferencing users was stolen and sold on the dark web.‚Äù 
										
										There were 350 cyberattacks in Switzerland during April 2020, whereas 100-150 was the average before the pandemic. Not to mention the increase in phishing attacks and that ‚Äú47% of individuals fall for a phishing scam while working at home‚Äù.  Cyber security is as important as ever, but individuals working from home have less support when it comes to the social engineering types of cyberattacks.  
										
										As the effects from the pandemic become more obvious, the need for stronger cyber security measures and an increase in education regarding how to protect yourself online and the ways threat actors operate will likely become more common place, especially for the businesses that continue to operate with a more work from home style. 
										
										 
										
										https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/risk/articles/impact-covid-cybersecurity.html 
										
										 
										
										</p><h1>How will this affect you?</h1><p> 
										
										I am seeking a career in cyber security so the fact that there is a constant need for more cyber security professionals is welcomed. Though, it would be better if cyber security was not needed but that is just not the world that we live in.  As the cyber threats around the world are constantly changing, it is a good idea to keep up with current trends and stay informed about emerging cyber threats. People will need to stay aware of the potential that they may be a target of a cyberattack. That the increase of people utilizing online methods for business will also increase the likelihood of those businesses being affected by cyberattacks or data breaches which also increases the need for cyber security.  
										
										I believe that the future of wars and conflicts may end up having a large portion of operations run through state sponsored cyberattacks targeting countries supply lines and infrastructure. This may directly or indirectly affect me as Australia may be a target of said state sponsored cyberattack or may affect one of our main trading partners reducing Australia‚Äôs economy or resources. There is also the chance that I move into the defense force in the cyber security sector.  That would mean I would be at the front line of these conflicts and have a firsthand experience dealing with these state sponsored cyberattacks. </p>
										<h1>What is machine learning</h1>
										<p>
											In the modern day, machine learning is the invisible technology that surrounds us. It is always there behind the scenes processing data. But what is it exactly? Essentially machine learning is a process in which a computer is fed a series of instructions and then set to work to identify and categorize data. An example of machine learning we see in our everyday lives is on Spotify. When we listen to a song on Spotify, the application will take that information and then supply the user with other songs that are similar. We, the user, give the machine information about what we enjoy, and it is then able to process it and suggest other songs for us to listen to. 
											
											There are three main machine learning algorithms that see wide use in the present, with a fourth gaining popularity. 
											
											Supervised Machine Learning 
											
											Unsupervised Machine Learning 
											
											Reinforcement Learning 
											
											These each have their own benefits and disadvantages as well as different uses in a variety of contexts but will continue to see usage for years to come. 
											
											Supervised Machine Learning is an algorithm where we input information that the program can then use to identify and categorize future inputs. For example, if we were to feed the program hundreds of images of cats and dogs, with each image being labelled, the algorithm would ideally be able to understand aspects of what makes a cat a cat, versus a dog. It will start looking for several aspects, like the shape of the eyes, ears, body and tail, the algorithm will then categorize it as either a cat or a dog. We commonly see this algorithm utilized in fraudulent email protection, determining a loan applicant‚Äôs viability and detecting fraudulent bank withdrawals. 
											
											Unsupervised Machine Learning is a somewhat messier approach. Essentially instead of teaching the algorithm what the information we are putting into it is, we will instead just allow the program to arbitrarily sort through the information and decide how to categorize it. This is useful to identify otherwise hidden patterns in datasets. This is widely seen in identifying customer‚Äôs behaviour, grouping it with other customers and recommending products based on the buying behaviour of other customers in the same group. 
											
											Reinforcement Learning is most closely related to how humans learn. Instead of being fed pre-labelled datasets, a machine running the algorithm is instead allowed to interact with its environment. The machine is then rewarded for its good behaviour and punished for its bad behaviour. Over time it is expected the machine can determine what it should do as opposed to what it shouldn‚Äôt do. This algorithm is often seen in robotics, self-driving cars and AI designed to play games. 
											
											Finally, a fourth algorithm is not fully embraced by everyone but is set to see more use in coming years. Semi-supervised Learning is a hybrid of supervised learning and unsupervised learning, hence the name. The algorithm is fed a small portion of labelled data, as well as a larger amount of unlabelled data, using this data it can sort the data to a high degree. Semi-supervised learning is still considered to be relatively new compared to the other methods but has already proven effective to minimize the issues that arise when using the other methods. 
											
											These algorithms are all seeing constant use presently but there are new innovations on the horizon, as with most cutting-edge technologies. Automated Machine Learning is already seeing some use but is expected to become much more refined in the near future.
